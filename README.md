# DenoisingAutoencoder
- Demo of a Denoising Autoencoder (DAE) learning vector fields for one-dimensional manifolds.

- Programmed for the seminar 'Concepts in Deep Learning' at the University of Osnabr√ºck (2024/2025) 

- By the group DataSippers

### Manifolds
In this demo, we will see how a denoising autoencoder will learn the vector field for three examples of one-dimensional manifolds: a line, a circle and a spiral.

*But a circle is not one but two-dimensional!* you may correctly say. That is where the concept of **manifolds** comes in. In mathematics, a manifold is a topological space that locally resembles
euclidean space. For example, we all know the earth is a sphere (I hope) but if we stand in an open field, it looks like we are standing on a plane, a two-dimensional space. 

For our circle let's imagine we are a little bug that is walking along the edge. From our point of view all we see is the point in front of us: a one-dimensional space.

Now, why is this interesting? According to the **manifold hypothesis**, "high dimensional data tends to lie in the vicinity of a low dimensional manifold" (Fefferman et al., 2016). That mean that our machine learning models would be able to fit "simpler" subspaces instead of having to fit high-dimensional input space and dimension reduction is always a win.

### Denoising Autoencoder 

What does our denoising autoencoder (DAE) have to do with all of this? Let us remember how it looks like:

Our DAE has to learn how to map corrupted inputs $\tilde{x}$ back to the original inputs $x$. For our circle example the red points are the noise.

When putting in new inputs coordinates to the trained DAE, we see where the DAE maps them to -> closer to the manifold!

That means our DAE not only approximates the function of a circle, but also of the vector field around it.
